# Code of conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Get Samurai project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication must never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults or other unprofessional conduct. We promise to maintain courtesy and respect for everyone involved in the project, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion or level of experience. We hope that anyone who contributes to the projects will do the same.

If any member violates this code of conduct, we will take appropriate steps to ensure that the disorder no longer occurs with any of our study community.
