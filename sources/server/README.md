## 🔖 About the project

This is the backend of the [Get Samurai app](https://github.com/NatanaelBorges/getSamurai/blob/main/README.md).

It is a RESTful API built with NodeJS + Express + MySql that receives all data related to available services and provides the client with all this data through a REST API.

The project aims to connect those who need it, with those who know how to do it, that is, the idea is to connect any type of service with the end user.

  The idea of the project is quite simple:

_“Share knowledge in the form of a service app, providing a simple way to learn”._

Get Samurai was developed with 3 key principles:

- 🧪 **Well Tested**
  - Each module is extensively tested to >95% coverage.
- 👁 **Well typed**
  - First class support for Typescript included.
- 📄 **Well documented**
  - Complete reference and installation documentation.

The project was developed with a focus on learning. All of its content is fictional.
